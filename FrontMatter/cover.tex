% This file contains the cover pages these are rather basic and depend on the imagery used
%                       - a change to your own cover image is needed
%                       - be mindfull of some tweaking

%% Titlepage enviroment is used for some commands
\begin{titlepage}

        %% This can be used to set a background image (for instance a base colour)
        %               - the oversize (1.07) is used to make sure that the image bleeds into the side
        %               - opacity is something to set
        \tikz[remember picture,overlay] \node[opacity=0.8,inner sep=0pt] at (current page.center){\includegraphics[width=1.07\paperwidth,height=1.07\paperheight]{FrontMatter/Cover/CoverBackground}};


        %% we center all text
        \begin{center}


        %% Text color is changed for readability
        %               - options are: white/black
        %               - additional colours are defined in the stylesheet
        \color{white}

        %% Print the title (ussually only the title is given)
        %               - Explicit control over fontsize is used to make it fit nicely
        {\makeatletter
                \largetitlestyle\fontsize{1.2cm}{13cm}\selectfont\@title
                \makeatother}

        \vfill


        %% This can be used to set a foreground image
        %               - Ussually some tweaking with vertical space is needed to place it exactly
